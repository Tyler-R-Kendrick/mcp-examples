# Anthropic’s Model Context Protocol (MCP) – A New Standard for AI Context Integration

## Introduction

Welcome! Today we’re diving into **Anthropic’s Model Context Protocol (MCP)** – an open standard that’s making waves in the AI world. Think of MCP as the “USB-C for AI applications,” a universal connector that lets AI systems plug into the data and tools we use every day[^1]. In this session, we’ll explore what MCP is, why it matters for developers (especially those of us in the .NET and Microsoft ecosystem), and how it’s implemented across **TypeScript, Python, and .NET**. By the end, you’ll see how MCP can fit into your developer workflow to build smarter, more connected applications.

<!--
> **Speaker notes:**
> Hello and welcome! If you’re a .NET developer curious about how to give your AI apps better access to data and services, you’re in the right place. We’ll break down Anthropic’s MCP – a new open protocol that everyone’s comparing to the “USB-C of AI”[^7]. It basically standardizes how AI models get context from external sources. We’ll keep it friendly and high-level, so you understand the concepts and practical benefits. Whether you code in C#, Python, or JavaScript/TypeScript, MCP has something for you. Let’s jump in!

## What is the Model Context Protocol (MCP)?

**MCP** is an **open standard protocol** introduced by Anthropic (the folks behind the Claude AI assistant) in late 2024[^9]. Its purpose is to bridge the gap between AI assistants and the real-world data and tools they need to be truly useful[^33]. Even the most advanced large language models have historically been *isolated* behind data silos – every new integration (be it your code repo, a database, or a SaaS app) required a custom solution[^33]. This made it hard to scale AI solutions because connecting to each data source was a one-off project. MCP addresses this challenge by providing **one universal protocol** for connecting AI systems with external sources, *replacing all those fragmented one-off integrations with a single, consistent approach*[^33]. In simpler terms, MCP lets AI models **read data from and write data to** other applications or databases through a standardized interface[^22].

<!--
> **Speaker notes:**
> So what exactly is MCP? In a nutshell, it’s an open standard – kind of like how HTTP is a standard for web communication – but here it’s for AI and context. Anthropic created MCP to solve a big pain point: our AI models (like chatbots or assistants) were stuck in their own bubble, unable to easily pull in information from the tools we use (think content repositories, business apps, dev tools, etc.). Traditionally, if you wanted your AI to access, say, Google Drive and a SQL database, you’d have to write two totally separate connectors. **MCP changes that**. It’s one protocol to rule them all[^33] – okay, maybe not rule, but to connect them all!
> ...
> In short, MCP is how we **plug our AI into the data pipelines** we already have, using a consistent method instead of reinventing the wheel for every new integration.

## Why Does MCP Matter for Developers?

**MCP matters because it unlocks smarter, more context-aware AI applications with less hassle.**
By using MCP to feed relevant context and tools to the model, we enable it to produce *better, more relevant responses*[^33] for our users.
For developers, this means:

* **No More Siloed AI:** Your AI assistant is no longer trapped in isolation. MCP lets it securely connect to the systems where your data lives – whether that’s a content repository, a CRM, a codebase, or a custom internal app[^33].
* **Single Standard vs. Custom Integrations:** Instead of writing and maintaining separate API connectors or plugins for every service, you build against one standard protocol[^33].
* **Flexibility and Vendor-Neutrality:** MCP is **LLM-agnostic** – it’s like a neutral translation layer. You can switch out the underlying model (Claude, GPT-4, etc.) or move between cloud providers without redoing your integrations[^13].
* **Security & Control:** The protocol is designed with enterprise needs in mind. It emphasizes secure, two-way connections where you can keep sensitive data within your infrastructure[^33][^13]. There are even mechanisms for **human-in-the-loop control**[^11].
* **Growing Ecosystem of Tools:** MCP isn’t just a spec on paper; it already has a rich and growing ecosystem. Anthropic kickstarted it by releasing **pre-built MCP servers** for popular systems like Google Drive, Slack, GitHub, Git, PostgreSQL databases, web browsers (via Puppeteer), and more[^33]. The community quickly took off from there – at this point, *hundreds* of MCP servers exist (if not more) covering all sorts of tools[^11].

<!--
> **Speaker notes:**
> Why should we, as developers, care about MCP? In one word: **empowerment**. It empowers our AI systems to actually use the data and tools we have, in a seamless way.
> ...
> There’s an analogy I like: it’s as if we’ve been building devices that each needed their own special charger, and then someone invents USB-C. Suddenly, one cable works for all. That’s what MCP aspires to be for AI integrations.
> ...
> MCP could be similarly transformative for AI apps.

## How MCP Works: Core Architecture

At its core, MCP follows a **client–server architecture**[^13]. Here are the key components:

* **MCP Server:** Exposes data and functionality from an external system in a standardized way[^22].
* **MCP Client:** Runs on the AI side. It sends requests and receives responses according to MCP’s specification[^11]. Maintains a **1:1 connection** to each server needed[^13].
* **Host Application (or “MCP Host”):** The overall application or environment where the AI operates and where context is needed[^13].
* **Data Sources (Local and Remote):** MCP servers can interface with **local data** or **remote services**[^13].

**Standard message types include:**

* `ListToolsRequest`
* `ListResourcesRequest`
* `CallToolRequest`
* `ReadResourceRequest`
* Other control messages like `InitializeRequest`, `PingRequest`, `CreateMessageRequest`, etc.[^11][^18]

<!-- 
> **Speaker notes:**
> Let’s visualize how this works...
> On the left, you have the **Host**... That host uses an MCP **Client**... On the right, we have several **MCP Servers**...
> All of this happens through a common protocol, so from the AI’s perspective, reading a file or calling a web service or querying a database all feel very similar – it’s just sending MCP messages.

## Where MCP Fits in Your Workflow

* **AI-Powered Applications:** MCP comes into play as the bridge to your app’s data[^22].
* **Developer Tools and IDEs:** Microsoft’s **Copilot Studio** and the **GitHub Copilot “agent mode” in VS Code** both have MCP under the hood[^9].
* **Enterprise Integration Projects:** MCP can simplify those integration projects when AI is involved.
* **Agent Orchestration and Workflows:** MCP is a natural fit for orchestrating agent frameworks.

<!--
> **Speaker notes:**
> Suppose it’s your job to integrate an AI assistant into your company’s internal portal – something to help employees query HR policies...
> With MCP, you can set up, for instance, an **HR Database MCP server** and a **Document MCP server**...
> In your development workflow, this means once the servers are up, you mostly operate at the level of “Does the AI know when to use which tool?” rather than writing boilerplate integration code.

## Best Practices for Using MCP in Your Projects

* **Start Small with Pre-built Connectors:**
  Use the [official MCP servers repo][mcp-servers] and community listings first[^33][^11].
* **Secure Your MCP Servers:**
  Treat them like any powerful microservice: require authentication, run in controlled environments, and monitor usage[^33][^18].
* **Use Human Oversight for Sensitive Actions:**
  Employ human-in-the-loop where needed; MCP supports this via protocol design[^11].
* **Optimize Context and Data Transfer:**
  Design tools to return only relevant data, keeping AI context windows efficient.
* **Stay Updated with the MCP Community:**
  Follow GitHub, forums, and Microsoft blogs[^8].
* **Testing and Development:**
  Use local/test MCP servers, record/replay interactions, and leverage streaming for performance.

<!--
> **Speaker notes:**
> A quick word on **performance**: MCP is fast, but local servers will be snappier than remote ones...
> Document your MCP integrations for your team...
