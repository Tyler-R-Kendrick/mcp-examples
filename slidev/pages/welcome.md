<!--
MCP (Model Context Protocol) is a standard way for AI applications and agents to connect to and work with your data sources and tools.

This means any API or existing codebase that you want a model to invoke. Or any data and/or file store that you want to make accessible.

MCP is Anthropic's answer to model interactions as a service. It standardizes not only tool calling, but also how to handle and expose the context in which they operate.
